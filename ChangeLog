New in version 3.1

New comparison code using the POPCNT instruction.  Marked speed improvements on intel, cache performance improvements on AMD.

Refined the searching/index components, including auto-generation of reference
set from large quantity of small files, search shortcuts, etc.  Indexes are
now stored compressed on disk using lz4.

More additions to --verbose as progress indicators.

Overhaul of sdhash-cli options, matching sdhash as closely as possible and much 
more flexible.  Also removing last traces of posix from sdhash-cli for inclusion 
into windows port.
--------
New in version 3.0

sdbf_set indexing method, to be generated with --index while hashing
and searched with --search-index while hashing.

temp-bugfix: some speedup for very small reference data
bugfix: segmenting was seeing too-large final segment on windows
--------
New in version 2.3

Web interface using python/jquery -- talks to thrift
--validate option
tons of --verbose debugging output
New thrift-server sources directory
bugfix: for invalid sdbf file reading no longer crashes
bugfix: windows recursive search filesystem permissions crash fixed

--------
New in version 2.2

Very beta native win32/win64 port
Threads updated to use boost::thread instead of pthreads directly
Program options updated to support all command line options in sdhash.cfg
Filesystem access now primarily c++/boost not posix
Thrift client/server now supports asynchronous mode comparisions
output file option -o --output 

--------

New in version 2.1

recursive directory hashing with --deep -r option
sdhash supports input from stdin
argument --segment-size -z to customize read-in segment size
argument --name -n to rename stdin hashes
new client/server programs using Thrift
api updates to use const and clearer naming conventions
api updated with formal 'set' class
sdhash auto-switching to block mode when files are >16MB
new base64 encoding library

--------


New in version 2.0

gnu-style long-options for standalone and client programs
configuration file capability for standalone sdhash sdhash.cfg
fixed: sdhash buffers large files instead of memory mapping the entire thing
sdhash server program sdhashd, and sdhash-cli client program.
Client and server should be considered beta software.
sdhash-dd program removed and changed to -b option for block size
sdbf version upgraded to add 'original size' into the header information
"view" option to create subsets of sets matching an expression
added: Boost libraries for regular expressions
fixed: import as file list now can use DD mode
fixed: sampling now non-destructive
swig-python bindings now exist with a sample program
Now large block hashes are "streamed" in chunks instead of as one giant hash.

---------

New in version 1.8

-i file.txt option to generate hashes from a file list. 
conversion to C++ 
beta libsdbf API 
fixed: off-by-one error on last line of query file

---------

New in version 1.7

-c query.sdbf target.sdbf option
-s sample option
