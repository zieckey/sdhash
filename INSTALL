INSTALL for sdhash 

recent versions of sdhash has been tested on the following platforms:

Fedora Core 16 and 17  64 bit
Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64 bit, 11.10 64 bit
Mac OS X 10.7 Lion
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

As of sdhash 3.1 we are moving to 64-bit capable processors
in order to take advantage of dramatically faster comparison rates.
On 64-bit processors without the popcnt instruction we fail down 
to the original style of population count.

Windows 7 32 and 64-bit 

32-bit windows will be supported for a short amount of time via creative
ifdefs.

See INSTALL.macosx and BUILD.windows for non-linux build
and installation notes.
